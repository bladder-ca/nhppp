Description: Simulates events from one dimensional nonhomogeneous Poisson point processes (NHPPPs) as per Trikalinos and Sereda (2024, <arXiv:2402.00358>). Functions are based on three algorithms that provably sample from a target NHPPP: the time-transformation of a homogeneous Poisson process (of intensity one) via the inverse of the integrated intensity function (Cinlar E, "Theory of stochastic processes" (1975, ISBN:0486497996)); the generation of a Poisson number of order statistics from a fixed density function; and the thinning of a majorizing NHPPP via an acceptance-rejection scheme (Lewis PAW, Shedler, GS (1979) <doi:10.1002/nav.3800260304>).
