Description: 
    The package simulates event times from arbitrary NHPPPs with 
    two methods: (i) Time warping recovers the target NHPPP with 
    an appropriate time-transformation of samples drawn from a 
    time-homogeneous Poisson PP. (ii) An acceptance-rejection 
    algorithm thins out a “denser” homogeneous Poisson PP to 
    obtain event times from the target NHPPP.
