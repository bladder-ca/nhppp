nhppp is a package for simulating events from one dimensional nonhomogeneous Poisson point processes (NHPPPs). Its functions are based on three algorithms that provably sample from a target NHPPP: the time-transformation of a homogeneous Poisson process (of intensity one) via the inverse of the integrated intensity function; the generation of a Poisson number of order statistics from a fixed density function; and the thinning of a majorizing NHPPP via an acceptance-rejection scheme. It was developed to provide fast and memory efficient functions for discrete event and statistical simulations. For a description of the algorithms and a numerical comparison with other R packages, see Trikalinos and Sereda (2024), accessible at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00358](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00358). 

## Installation

You can install the release version of nhppp from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("nhppp")
```

You can install the development version of nhppp from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bladder-ca/nhppp")
```

## Example

These examples use the generic function `draw()`, which is a wrapper for the packages specific functions. `draw()` is a non-vectorized function, but `nhppp` includes vectorized functions that are fast and have small memory footprint. 

Consider the time varying intensity function $\lambda(t) = e^{(0.2t)} (1 + \sin t)$, which is a sinusoidal intensity function with an exponential amplitude. To draw samples over the interval $(0, 6\pi]$ execute 

```{r example_lambda}
l <- function(t) (1 + sin(t)) * exp(0.2 * t)
nhppp::draw(lambda = l, 
            line_majorizer_intercept = l(6 * pi),
            line_majorizer_slope = 0,  
            t_min = 0, 
            t_max = 6 * pi) |>
  head(n = 20)
```

where `line_majorizer_intercept` and `line_majorizer_slope` define a majorizer constant. 

When available, the integrated intensity function $\Lambda(t) = \int_0^t \lambda(s) \ ds$ and its inverse $\Lambda^{-1}(z)$ result in faster simulation times. For this example, $\Lambda(t) = \frac{e^{0.2t}(0.2 \sin t - \cos t)+1}{1.04} + \frac{e^{0.2t} - 1}{0.2}$; $\Lambda^{-1}(z)$ is constructed numerically upfront (or can be calculated numerically by the function, at a computational cost). 

```{r example_big_lambda}
L <- function(t) {
  exp(0.2 * t) * (0.2 * sin(t) - cos(t)) / 1.04 +
    exp(0.2 * t) / 0.2 - 4.038462
}
Li <- stats::approxfun(x = L(seq(0, 6 * pi, 10^-3)), y = seq(0, 6 * pi, 10^-3), rule = 2)

nhppp::draw(Lambda = L, Lambda_inv = Li, t_min = 0, t_max = 6 * pi) |>
  head(n = 20)
```
